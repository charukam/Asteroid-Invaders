# asteroid-invaders

Using pygame, and watching a few YouTube tutorials to learn Python and Object-Orientated Programming, I created this simple game.
All art assets were also created by me using paint.net.
Sound assets were found online for free use.

Arrow keys to move, space to shoot. Earn a certain highscore to unlock a more powerful spaceship. Avoid the asteroids and powerup nerfs, while picking up powerup buffs and shooting down as many asteroids as you can.
